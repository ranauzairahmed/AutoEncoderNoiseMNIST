This project demonstrates the use of a convolutional autoencoder to denoise images from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to train an autoencoder to remove Gaussian noise added to the original images, thereby restoring them to their cleaner form. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging convolutional layers for feature extraction and upsampling layers for image reconstruction. Noisy images are generated by adding Gaussian noise, and the autoencoder is trained to minimize the reconstruction error between the noisy inputs and the clean targets. The model is evaluated on a test set, and the denoised images are compared with the original and noisy images to assess the effectiveness of the denoising process.
