# AutoEncoderNoiseMNIST
This project implements a convolutional autoencoder to denoise MNIST images by adding Gaussian noise. The model is trained to remove the noise, and the denoised images are evaluated against the original and noisy images, showcasing the autoencoder's effectiveness in image restoration.
